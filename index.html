            <p>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. <br>
                Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than 
                that of humans. <br> Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; 
                four toes on each back paw). <br> Cats can jump up to six times their length.

                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. <br>
                    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to <br>
                     as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                    </p>

                            The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong 
                            flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. 
                            Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
